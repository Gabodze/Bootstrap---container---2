                        <p class="description">I'm a passionate, <a href="https://www.figma.com/@shahsagarm" target="_blank"><u>self-proclaimed designer</u></a> who specializes in full stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.</p>
                
                        <p class="description"> I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.</p>

                        <p class="description">I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development. </p>
                    
                        <p class="description">When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/login?redirect_after_login=%2Fshahsagarm" target="_blank"><u>Twitter</u></a> where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on <a href="https://github.com/shahsagarm" target="_blank"><u>GitHub</u></a>.</p>
